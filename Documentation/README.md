 *Simple practice problems to brush up your programming. Also useful when learning the syntax of a new language*

**Steps**
* Think of a solution on paper or whiteboard.
* Impelement it
* Analyize it


**Easy**
* Print all the elements of an array
* Search an array to find an element
* Search an array to find the number of occurences of an element
* Reverse an array
* Check if an array is a palindrome
* Find the largest element in an array
* Find the index of the largest element in an array

**Sort**
* Sort an array

**Recursive vs Iterative Solutions**
* Find the nth fibonacci number
* Find the factorial of a number
* Implement binary search

**Analysis**
* Identify the key operation - comparison, assignment etc

**OOP**
* Write a car class with attributes - make, model, color.
* Write a greet method
* Implement a linked list
* Implement a tree

**Techniques**
* Use a flag to break out of an inner loop
* Initialize the variable
* Loops - Condition & Incrementor
* Ruby way to do things
* The good thing about algorithms is, you are faster when you don't plan ahead. 
* Just keep coding

**Beware**
* Check for the return statement
* Check the names and conflicts between method names and variable names

* `return` vs `break`
  * `return` is when you have the solution
  * `break` is when you know your solution is not in this iteration, so you want to continue with the next iteration

* Traversals
  * Outer Loop vs Inner Loop
  * Outer loop - The outer loop index is stationed at each variable, while the inner loop index traverses the array

* Traversal - 2
  * You might need to traverse the entire length
  * Sometimes you only traverse half the length ( for reversal problems )
  *
